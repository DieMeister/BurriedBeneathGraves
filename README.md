This is the Wiki of an ongoing D&D campaign. Files might not  be complete or up to date since it's a work in progress.
# For people who know the campaign
This is all the information i was able to get out of the sessions, or data our DM gave us in some other way. Not included are raw AudioFiles or AudacityProjectFiles. If you want to add information you can either tell me in person or open a pull request, both works for me.
