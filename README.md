This is a copy of my DnD ObsidianVault. This includes general DnD information as well as notes to the ongoing campaign "Buried beneath Graves". 
# For people who know the campaign
You can find all the campaign information in the BuriedBeneathGraves folder.  
This is all the information i was able to get out of the sessions, or data our DM gave us in some other way. Not included are raw AudioFiles or AudacityProjectFiles. If you want to add information you can either tell me in person or open a pull request, both works for me.
